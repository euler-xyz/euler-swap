! Better revert messages when a swap fails due to maglev debt-limit/vault utilisation/etc
  * currently it's an arithmetic underflow
! Don't make quotes that would cause a swap to fail if supply/borrow caps exceeded
? permit2 instead of regular approval: measure gas savings
? a really small swap could fail because deposit() results in 0 shares, which EVK fails on. call convertToShares() first? Seems like overkill
? how should aggregators find instances
  ? factory/registry contract
  ? fake registry contract that looks at the actually installed operators for a list of accounts
  ? transparent proxy so AMM address can stay constant

docs
  periphery split
  low-level detail of how system works for auditors
  information for aggregators
    how to maintain quotes off-chain, including tracking cash from VaultStatus logs of underlying vaults
  note how EVK stores balance and debt in same storage slot

tests
  when exchange rate in vaults != 1
  uniswap callback, flash swaps
  hitting reserve/utilisation limits
