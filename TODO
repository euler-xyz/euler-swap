! Don't make quotes that would cause a swap to fail if supply/borrow caps exceeded
* Better revert messages when a swap fails due to maglev debt-limit/vault utilisation/etc
  * currently it's an arithmetic underflow


TESTING

* when exchange rate in vaults != 1
* uniswap callback, flash swaps
* hitting reserve/utilisation limits
* AssetsOutOfOrderOrEqual


MISC

? A really small swap could fail because deposit() results in 0 shares, which causes EVK to revert. Call convertToShares() first? Seems like overkill...
? permit2 instead of regular approval: measure gas savings
* Improve the efficiency of on-chain quoting
  * Probably necessary for supporting non-zero slippage swaps
  * Use unchecked math in verify() (needs careful boundary analysis)
  * Closed-form quoting solutions
  * "Range hints" for the binary search


IDEAS

* Currently we have only been supporting stable-stable pairs
  * What extra considerations would there be for floating pairs?
* Automatically re-invest fees? There are a few options:
  * Don't do anything: Re-deploing probably isn't a huge deal
  * Increase the reserves by the fee amount
  * Increase the reserves by the extra amount of possible leverage supported by the new fee
  * Apply fees to a super-concentrated middle section of the curve (needs R&D)
* Could current reserves be calculated dynamically based on balances/debts/debt limits?
  * I guess you would lose a chunk of interest to arbitrage
  * Donation attacks?
* What can we do to make this easily integrated with aggregators/MEV bots/etc?
  * How to handle a discovery/tracking of the different Maglev instances?
    ? Factory? Registry? Maybe a fake factory that reads the actually installed operators from a set of addresses?
    ? Transparent proxy so a Maglev address can stay constant
